# Chapter 16: Packaging Python Libraries

## Summary

16.1 - Python 3 and the `Distutils` packaging framework.  
16.2 - Don't forget to choose a license, classify your package and add a README!  
16.3 - Directory organization and multi-file modules.  
16.4 - writing the `setup.py` script.  
16.5 - Adding package classifications. Always!  
16.6 - Including extra files with a `MANIFEST.in` file.  
16.7 - `setup.py check` to validate your `setup.py` metadata.  
16.8 - `setup.py sdist` to build a source distribution.  
16.9 - Always make a gui installer for Windows users with `setup.py bdist_wininst`.  
16.10 - Steps to add your package to PYPI.  
16.11 - other frameworks and tools for packaging and installation.  

See `/chardet` dir for my sample `chardet` package created by yours truly.
Obviously I skipped the last step and didn't upload it to PYPI.
But I did make a GUI installer for Windows!


Fin!
