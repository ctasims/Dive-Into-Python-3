# Dive-Into-Python-3

This project is comprised of my exercises and notes on **Dive Into Python 3** by Mark Pilgrim.

I'll use a pseudo-classical, compressed approach with two steps:

## Step 1
Read each chapter with the goal of understanding the "Grammar". 
What is it about?
What are the key points?  
At the end of each section write a brief summary to capture the key point(s).

## Step 2
Re-read the chapter and work through each exercise manually.
This includes command-line code and scripts.
Add extra notes if it helps, but don't overdo it.  
The goal here to understand the "Why?".
Focus on the key points discovered in Step 1.

All code was written by me. No copy-pasting!
