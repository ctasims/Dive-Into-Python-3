# Dive-Into-Python-3

This project is comprised of my exercises and notes on **Dive Into Python 3** by Mark Pilgrim.

I endeavors to use a pseudo-classical approach to this book.
I first read each chapter.
At the end of each section I wrote a brief summary of the section.
I then re-read the chapter and worked through each exercise manually.
This included command-line code and scripts.
I would add any extra notes I thought were helpful.

All code was written by me. No copy-pasting!
