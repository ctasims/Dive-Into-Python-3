# Chapter 7: Classes & Iterators

## Summary

7.2 The structure and conventions for creating a class with an `__init__` method.
7.3 Simple example of isntantiating an instance of a class.
7.4 Instance variables, `self.max`, are specific to the instance and accessible in each method.
7.5 Creating an example iterator for the Fibonacci sequence. It only needs an `__iter__` method (and a `__next__` method?) to be an iterator.
7.6 Convert our pluralizer into an efficient module that uses an iterator to pluralize words.
